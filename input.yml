#Input yaml file for cententExtractor.rb.
#It's an array of hashes. Here is an example.
#To use this you just have to respect this syntax and know the "xpath" of the data you want to extract.
#For more information about the xpath go check this page: http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/getting-started-with-nokogiri/ .
#If you want the text, put text in extract, else, the name of the attribute, like src, alt or id.
