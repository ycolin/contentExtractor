This Ruby script enables data extraction from html pages at specified locations.
It's useful for example if you want to rebuild a site.
If you know the 'xpath' with the right classes or id names, you can extract either text or attributes such as src, alt, id...
You need to save the web page on your computer, write the ylm file (an example is given in this repository),
the script will extract the data for you and put it in a hash table (and also print it).
See the commentaries in the other files for more details.
